# Python-Midterm-Project

This is a Python script to calculate the most frequently recurring sequence of characters within a text file. 

If you choose the text file to represent a series of DNA fragments, this code represents a solution to find
the most probable restriction enzyme binding sites (because these enzymes always cleave DNA in the same location, thus creating 
fragments that have the same repeating nucleotide sequences at the ends)

This project was written for my class "Scientific Computing: MATLAB, Python, and R".
